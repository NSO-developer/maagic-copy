# Stages for our CI jobs
# Gitlab only allows the specification of one progression of stages. We use two
# different "modes" for running our jobs, which are essentially mutually
# exclusive. In the special CI_MODE=mirror, there is only a single mirror job
# that runs in the mirror stage. For a normal CI run, the other stages are used.
stages:
  - mirror
  - build

# The before script makes sure that docker is installed, since that is a
# prerequisite for most jobs. If the jobs are run with a standard debian or
# Ubuntu image, docker isn't installed. To speed up the build, this install step
# can be skipped by running an image that already has docker installed, for
# example registry.gitlab.com/nso-developer/ci-runner-image:latest
#
# We also define the helper functions mark_section_start/end that help us mark
# out the start and end of a "section" in a CI job. Each section can be folded
# and gets a duration timestamp in the CI job view making it easy to see how
# long it took to run.

# Special CI job for running a mirroring job that pulls in the latest changes

# Version set to include. These file contain the actual jobs that instantiate
# the templates above for various version of NSO. The default is to build for
# all supported NSO versions by including a CI config file from the upstream
# nso-docker repository. It is normal to build your own version set for the NSO
# versions you are interested in and include that here.
include: 'https://gitlab.com/nso-developer/nso-docker/-/raw/master/version-sets/supported-nso/build-tot.yaml'
# For example, replace it with the URL to your mirror of the nso-docker repo and
# the version-set you use;
# include: 'https://example.com/foo/nso-docker/-/raw/master/version-sets/bar/build-tot.yaml'
#
# Or if it is hosted on the same GitLab instance as this repo, you can use a
# relative link:
# include: 'foo/nso-docker/-/raw/master/version-sets/bar/build-tot.yaml'
#
# An alternative is to specify the build jobs manually, like so:
#
# build-5.3.1:
#   extends: .build
#   variables:
#     NSO_VERSION: "5.3.1"
#
# This isn't recommended other than perhaps for a quick test. It is much better
# to build a version-set on your main NSO system repo and include it so you
# build all your repositories for a consistent set of versions.
