# Stages for our CI jobs
# Gitlab only allows the specification of one progression of stages. We use two
# different "modes" for running our jobs, which are essentially mutually
# exclusive. In the special CI_MODE=mirror, there is only a single mirror job
# that runs in the mirror stage. For a normal CI run, the other stages are used.
stages:
  - mirror
  - build

# The before script makes sure that docker is installed, since that is a
# prerequisite for most jobs. If the jobs are run with a standard debian or
# Ubuntu image, docker isn't installed. To speed up the build, this install step
# can be skipped by running an image that already has docker installed, for
# example registry.gitlab.com/nso-developer/ci-runner-image:latest

# Special CI job for running a mirroring job that pulls in the latest changes

# Version set to include. These file contain the actual jobs that instantiate
# the templates above for various version of NSO. The default is to build for
# all supported NSO versions by including a CI config file from the upstream
# nso-docker repository. It is normal to build your own version set for the NSO
# versions you are interested in and include that here.
include: 'https://gitlab.com/nso-developer/nso-docker/-/raw/master/version-sets/supported-nso/build-tot.yaml'
